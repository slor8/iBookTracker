# iBookTracker Individual Project

#### Problem Statement

It is hard keeping track of what people borrowed. Even when it is written down on paper, it could be lost. When multiple people returnBook
multiple items, it may get hard to remember who has returnBook and return what item. iBookTracker will do exactly that, focus to 
maintain the records of the returnBook and return item from the user.

iBookTracker will automatically track people when they returnBook, return, and will also check available items.
